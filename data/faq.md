### Badges & Badge Pick-up

To expedite the check-in process, we’ll begin badge pick-up on Thursday, October 11, (location will be published). Make sure to bring your ticket along with student/lecturer ID (for EDU tickets), as we’ll need to verify it prior to assigning you your DevFest Nairobi badge. If you don’t have proper identification, you won’t be able to receive a badge and won’t be admitted to the conference.

Everyone is guaranteed a seat for the keynotes but the best seats will be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis during badge pick-up beginning at 9AM on October 12th. So make sure to come in on time!

Please note, you may not share, give, or otherwise provide your badge to anyone. DevFest Nairobi badges aren’t replaceable, so don't lose yours or you won’t be readmitted to the conference. You must wear your DevFest Nairobi badge to gain admission to the conference, including the sessions, workshops, and afterparty. If requested by security, please display or provide additional identification. DevFest Nairobi badges may include your name, company or work title (if provided).
